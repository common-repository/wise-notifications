Send updates using push notifications to your iOS website visitors. Requires an active plan on Now Push Notify.

== Description ==

Retain your iPhone site visitors using push notifications. Send updates using push notifications to your iOS website visitors.

To use this plugin you need an active plan on [Now Push Notify](https://notifiy.nowpush.app).

== Why do I need this plugin? ==

Web push notifications (browser notifications) are not supported by iOS devices, such as iPhone or iPad. Even if you use other services to send browser notifications, this is not possible for iOS. This plugin allows you to send push notifications to your iPhone/iPad visitors through our iOS App. Your visitors can easily subscribe: it takes **only one tap to subscribe for push notifications** if they have the [Now Push Notify iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/lr/app/wise-notifications/id1448382937), installed or two taps if they don't.

== I am already sending newsletters, why sending push notifications? ==

Push notifications have a better engagement rate meaning a **higher** CTR, and using Now Push Notify your Push Notifications will be super easy to subscribe to - one tap is enough.

== Why web push notifications for iOS? ==

Around 29% of site visitors from the USA are using iOS¹. That means that even if you are currently using browser notifications, you are missing almost 1/3 of your audience.

Did you know that recent study² by the University of Chicago found that there is a correlation between iPhone/iPad ownership and how wealth, namely *no individual brand is as predictive of being high-income as owning an Apple iPhone*? So, to send push notifications to iOS devices could prove very productive with a great ROI.

== How it works? ==

* Subscribe to a plan on [Now Push Notify](https://notify.nowpush.app).
* Complete site setup (takes less than 5 min and step by step guide is available).
* A widget is added to your website so the users can subscribe to your notifications.
* Once subscribed and [Now Push Notify App](https://itunes.apple.com/lr/app/wise-notifications/id1448382937) installed, your visitors will get a notification when you publish a new post/page (including custom posts).

NOTE: Push notification data (your WordPress site title, post title, post URL, post thumbnail) is sent to the Now Push Notify API, i.e. https://api.wisenotifications.com/v1/ when a new notification is generated in order for your subscribers to get the update. Our [terms of use](https://nowpush.app/terms-and-conditions.html) and [privacy policy](https://nowpush.app/privacy_policy.html) apply.

For detailed instructions, see the [Installation](#installation) section.

**PRO TIP:** if you use [OneSignal](https://wordpress.org/plugins/onesignal-free-web-push-notifications/) to send browser notifications, then the Now Push Notify plugin will send iOS push notifications considering your OneSignal plugin setting – that is, every time a notification is sent by OneSignal, an iOS push notification will also be sent by Now Push Notify.
